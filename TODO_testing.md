# Thorough Testing Checklist for Trip State Management Refactoring

## Critical Path Testing
- [ ] Verify stats-panel (duration and distance) and controls-panel (Start Trip, Pause, Resume, Stop Trip buttons) are visible and functional in both Dashboard and TripsDashboard components.
- [ ] Test trip functionality (starting, stopping, tracking duration and distance) works correctly across both components.
- [ ] Confirm the overlay in TripsDashboard displays the header and completed activities list properly over the map.
- [ ] Check for no console errors or rendering issues in the browser.

## Thorough Testing Areas
- [ ] Navigate through all pages (Dashboard, TripsDashboard, Community, Profile) and interact with trip-related buttons.
- [ ] Test trip start/stop in both components to ensure state synchronization.
- [ ] Verify map rendering and path display during active trips.
- [ ] Check responsiveness on different screen sizes.
- [ ] Test edge cases like stopping a trip without starting one, or rapid button clicks.
- [ ] Verify trip data is saved correctly to Firebase after stopping a trip.
- [ ] Test navigation between pages while a trip is active.
- [ ] Confirm trip stop modal appears and functions correctly.
- [ ] Check that trip stats update in real-time during active trips.
- [ ] Test logout and login while trip state is preserved (if applicable).
